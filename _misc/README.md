### PF/PU/RC Compatible 12V Motor Components

- `12V_connecting_rod` - A modern recreation of the original Lego connecting rod (x460) for use with modern motors. Please note that this part is slightly longer than the original in order to be compatible with modern Lego motors' wheel spacing.
- `12V_technic_wheel` - A Lego technic axle version of a 12V motor wheel for use with modern Lego motors (RC/PF/PU). Please note that this wheel _will_ connect with the original 12V connecting rods (x460), but the distance between wheels on modern motors is different to the original 12V motors. Please use `12V_connecting_rod` with these wheels.

### Custom 4.5V/12V Connectors

These connector housings are for use with _Conrad Electronic_ "2.6mm model railway" plugs and sockets. Only the metal pins and sockets (not sleeves) from the _Conrad Electronic_ parts are necessary. The plugs and sockets differ slightly from the Lego counterparts but are mostly compatible:

- Pin diameter of 2.55mm (Lego original 2.6mm)
- Lego pins can fit into the Conrad sockets, but only partially with great friction.
- Conrad pins can fit into Lego sockets but must be slightly splayed.
- Housings are slightly wider than original.

It is advisable to use these connectors exclusively with each other and to not connect them with Lego original connectors. Should you need to connect a Lego plug to a Conrad socket, replace the Lego plug with a Conrad equivalent instead.

- `dual_plug_housing` - An equivalent to the Lego dual-plug connector. Version with center pin. Requires 2 _Conrad Electronic_ pins.
- `dual_socket_housing` - Socket version of the dual plug housing above. Has a hole to receive the dual plug's center pin. Lacks top-entry holes for orthogonal connections. Requires 2 _Conrad Electronic_ sockets.
- `wide_plug_housing` - Wide version of the dual-plug connector for use with the 12V controller's regulated output. Depth is equivalent to the standard dual plug housing. Lacks top-entry holes for orthogonal connections. Requires 2 _Conrad Electronic_ pins.

**NOTE:** The original gray Lego wires are 22awg (0.34mm<sup>2</sup>) dual stereo wire. 1.27mm (0.1") pitch ribbon cable is a suitable substitute for the original wire due to its gray colour and lack of marking stripe (when spliced), though is typically smaller in gauge, thinner, and a lighter shade of insulation. You can search for "Speaker Wire" with similar specifications to the original Lego wire, though almost all options have a black polarity stripe.
