# Motor Repair (Incomplete WIP)

### 12V motor necromancy - proceed at your own risk...

Members of the 12V community have been unable to repair their broken motors in the decades that have passed since the 12V system was sold. While many have discovered how to disassemble and service their motors, few have had success in restoring motors with the all-too-common failure mode - the dreaded melted commutator. This project documents a complete repair procedure for restoring a broken motor without using donor parts from another motor. The result is not only a functioning motor, but one with improved torque and smoother running characteristics.

**NOTE:** While other projects in this repository document completely new designs that can be made without existing items, this project differs in that you need an original Lego 12V motor (bb0012v) to proceed.

### Repair Procedure Applications

This repair procedure can be used to remedy many broken motor states. The following can be achieved using this procedure:

- Repair a motor with a melted commutator.
- Repair a motor with cracked axle gears.
- Upgrade a functioning motor (equivalent to a full repair).

## Disassembling a Motor

_This project is an incomplete WIP. I am working hard to deliver a functioning repair procedure and am 80% of the way there. While I have yet to finish the procedure, you can find the current 3D printable parts in_ `/mechanical/`.
