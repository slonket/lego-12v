# Signals (Incomplete WIP)

### Re-imagined 12V signal bricks in the style of German "Hp" light signals

The majority of 12V gray-era sets are inspired by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB); even the turnouts feature a "lantern" brick akin to those on German turnouts. The 12V signal brick (70022), however, does not hold a connection to a real German counterpart. This project reimagines the Lego signal head as two different German Hp signals ("home" and "entry") while maintaining the original's blocky charm.

**NOTE:** "TLG signal", "Lego signal", "12V Lego signal head" and any similar combination all refer to the brick (70022). The mast and other components are currently not the subject of this project.

### Design Considerations

The foundation of this project is the question "what if TLG _did_ model their signal after a German original?". As such, an intersection of design considerations appears from the constraints of TLG's signal head, and the shape of a German Hp signal. These are the constraints I've distilled that satisfy a union of both:

- Must be a similar size to the signal brick.
- Must be dimensioned using the 1.6mm "Lego unit".
- Must use 5mm THT LEDs.
- Signal cowls should inherit the dimensions of the signal brick.
- Should connect to the mast brick (4168) similarly to the signal brick.

### Features

- Functions identically to the original signal.
- Size of two stacked 2x4 plates.
- Two different versions:
    - "Home" displaying Hp0 (red) and Hp1 (green).
    - "Entry" displaying Hp0 (red) and Hp2 (yellow + green).
- Jumper studs for centered mounting on mast.
- BYO LEDs! Your choice of brightness and colours.
